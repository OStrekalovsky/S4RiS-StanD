Experimental branch "Outsiders" was added.
You can define inside log JSON list of contestants "outsider" - they positions will not affect the other contestants places.
"Outsider" did not take up any place in standings, but his results will be unfrozen like other contestants.
For example - look at "log examples/test-contest-with-outsiders.txt"
